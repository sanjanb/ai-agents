# AI Agents — Overview

This section introduces AI agents: what they are, how they differ from models, and practical guidance to build them.

Goals:

- Explain the core concepts behind agents (sensors, actuators, state, goals, policies).
- Show simple, reproducible examples you can run locally.
- Provide a learning path: Getting started, Tutorials, Examples, and Reference.

Quick links

- Getting started — a minimal agent you can run: `getting-started.md`
- Tutorials — step-by-step guides (coming soon)
- Examples — ready-to-run agent templates (coming soon)

Who is this for?

- Engineers who want to wrap models into goal-driven systems.
- Students learning practical agent design.

Design principles

- Keep examples small and reproducible.
- Prefer standard tools and clear contracts (inputs/outputs, error modes).
- Highlight safety, evaluation, and reproducibility for each agent.

Next: Getting started — a tiny agent you can run locally.
